# mark2down
Online Markdown editor with some special features

## Installation
### Dependencies
- python 2.x
- web.py

...and some other will appear with new features soon.

## Running the server
### On Linux (UN*X, Mac)

- Clone & change to project directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/word-killers/mark2down.git
$ cd mark2down
```
- make `server.py` executable and run: 

```
$ chmod +x server.py
$ ./server.py
```

Now, you should be to able view the Editor page at <http://localhost:8080/>. To stop the server, use [Ctrl] + [C] in the
terminal.

In case of errors when running `server.py` try instead running it with `$ python server.py` or `$ python2 server.py`.
For more info (production server etc.) see http://webpy.org.

### On Windows
I have no clue yet. Will find out soon.

## Usage
Yes.
